- add a task using the mouse or keyboard.<br>
- mark any task as completed, using the mouse or keyboard. <br>
- delete any task, using the mouse or keyboard.<br>
- edit any task, using the mouse or keyboard.<br>
- view a specific subset of tasks: All tasks, only the active task, or only the completed tasks.<br>
